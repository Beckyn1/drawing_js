				<h3>Sprint Review</h3>

 <p>In this Sprint, I wanted to be able to use my mouse to pick a place on the canvas and drag the mouse
 to create a rectangle that stays on the canvas. This is a simple function which most of my future builds will
 be modelled off of. Based on my testing, it does the basic functions as expected and well. However,
	 I found a few errors that I will need to fix in a later sprint. </p>
				<ol>
					<li>A error I had was that when you dragged from outside the canvas, a rectangle appeared in the top
					left corner that extended to where the mouses position last was. I will need to look into fixing
					this in a later sprint.  I need to consider that if the user goes outside the canvas, if a rectangle
					will appear in the part of their drag that is within the canvas, or for no rectangle to appear at all.</li>
					<li>Another error I had was where when you started your mouse from inside the canvas and dragged it out,
					no rectangle appeared. In terms of designing a drawing program, I would like to fix this later so that
					a rectangle will still appear under this circumstance.</li>
					<li>I also found that when you move the mouse and then tap the touchpad on a macbook a randomly sized
					rectangle appears. It only does this when you tap the touchpad not click it though, so I'm not sure
					how I would go about fixing this as it seems like a rather complex issue, however, I will look into it
					nonetheless.</li>
					<li>Design wise, I want to change the appearance of the lines/circle guideline for the rectangle. It
					does not look aesthetically pleasing nor professional, so in a later sprint I will possibly take the lines
					and the circle out or just redesign how it works.</li>
					<li>In my next sprint, I also want to look into creating more shapes.</li>
				</ol>

<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
				<p> The purpose of this sprint was to create buttons that relate to ellipse and rectangle functions.</p>

<h3>Sprint Review</h3>
				<p>In this sprint I made an ellipse function where the user can drag and drop an ellipse that fills in with
				a colour and I also made buttons which control the shape functions. I am happy with how the ellipse function
				works and I also changed the design of the rectangle function so it looks cleaner (no lines or circle in
				the middle). My buttons work sufficiently as expected but I want to change the placement and aesthetic design of them.</p>

				<h4>Testing</h4>
				<ol>
					<li><video class="center" controls>
						<source src="assets/vids/s2_test2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					</video>
				<p>	For my first design of the ellipse function, my drawing stroke guide didn't match up with the filled
					ellipse that was created. The stroke guide was dragged but the filled ellipse appeared at a different position
					and a smaller size. I managed to fix this, however, as I found out that I was setting the measurements
					for the ellipse twice, so in my init file with the ellipse object and when I called the ellipse object.
				</p></li>

						<p>
							In this test video I was trying to test one of my methods for the buttons that correspond to a shape.
							I was trying to use true and false to set when the drawing guide for each shape would be drawn. However,
							this did not work as the previous drawing guide would appear for the first shape of the new shape clicked, instead
							of the shape clicked's drawing guide. To fix this issue, I found out that my interactive button selected
							was set to null, so I changed it to "placeholder" and then was able to set if statements to make the correct
							drawing guides when the shapes are clicked.
						</p>

						<p>This is my final test video for sprint 2. All my buttons and shape functions worked as expected but I still
						have the errors of going outside of the canvas and trying to make a shape, and the issue where moving the mouse
						and tapping the touchpad would create a random shape. I will fix these in my next sprint as I plan on creating
						an area where you can only draw in (buttons in a separate area) and this should resolve the boundary errors.</p>
