				<h3>Sprint Review</h3>

 <p>In this Sprint, I wanted to be able to use my mouse to pick a place on the canvas and drag the mouse
 to create a rectangle that stays on the canvas. This is a simple function which most of my future builds will
 be modelled off of. Based on my testing, it does the basic functions as expected and well. However,
	 I found a few errors that I will need to fix in a later sprint. </p>
				<ol>
					<li>A error I had was that when you dragged from outside the canvas, a rectangle appeared in the top
					left corner that extended to where the mouses position last was. I will need to look into fixing
					this in a later sprint.  I need to consider that if the user goes outside the canvas, if a rectangle
					will appear in the part of their drag that is within the canvas, or for no rectangle to appear at all.</li>
					<li>Another error I had was where when you started your mouse from inside the canvas and dragged it out,
					no rectangle appeared. In terms of designing a drawing program, I would like to fix this later so that
					a rectangle will still appear under this circumstance.</li>
					<li>I also found that when you move the mouse and then tap the touchpad on a macbook a randomly sized
					rectangle appears. It only does this when you tap the touchpad not click it though, so I'm not sure
					how I would go about fixing this as it seems like a rather complex issue, however, I will look into it
					nonetheless.</li>
					<li>Design wise, I want to change the appearance of the lines/circle guideline for the rectangle. It
					does not look aesthetically pleasing nor professional, so in a later sprint I will possibly take the lines
					and the circle out or just redesign how it works.</li>
					<li>In my next sprint, I also want to look into creating more shapes.</li>
				</ol>

<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
				<p> The purpose of this sprint was to create buttons that relate to ellipse and rectangle functions.</p>

<h3>Sprint Review</h3>
				<p>In this sprint I made an ellipse function where the user can drag and drop an ellipse that fills in with
				a colour and I also made buttons which control the shape functions. I am happy with how the ellipse function
				works and I also changed the design of the rectangle function so it looks cleaner (no lines or circle in
				the middle). My buttons work sufficiently as expected but I want to change the placement and aesthetic design of them.</p>

				<h4>Testing</h4>
				<ol>
					<li><video class="center" controls>
						<source src="assets/vids/s2_test2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					</video>
				<p>	For my first design of the ellipse function, my drawing stroke guide didn't match up with the filled
					ellipse that was created. The stroke guide was dragged but the filled ellipse appeared at a different position
					and a smaller size. I managed to fix this, however, as I found out that I was setting the measurements
					for the ellipse twice, so in my init file with the ellipse object and when I called the ellipse object.
				</p></li>

						<p>
							In this test video I was trying to test one of my methods for the buttons that correspond to a shape.
							I was trying to use true and false to set when the drawing guide for each shape would be drawn. However,
							this did not work as the previous drawing guide would appear for the first shape of the new shape clicked, instead
							of the shape clicked's drawing guide. To fix this issue, I found out that my interactive button selected
							was set to null, so I changed it to "placeholder" and then was able to set if statements to make the correct
							drawing guides when the shapes are clicked.

						<p>This is my final test video for sprint 2. All my buttons and shape functions worked as expected but I still
						have the errors of going outside of the canvas and trying to make a shape, and the issue where moving the mouse
						and tapping the touchpad would create a random shape. I will fix these in my next sprint as I plan on creating
						an area where you can only draw in (buttons in a separate area) and this should resolve the boundary errors.</p>

<h1>Sprint Three</h1>
<p>In this sprint I added a smaller drawing space for the user to draw on.</p>
				<img class="img-responsive"  src="assets/img/sprint_3_plan1.png" alt="">
				<img class="img-responsive"  src="assets/img/sprint_3_kb.png" alt="">

				<p>In this sprint I added a smaller canvas in for the user to draw on. This separated the buttons from the space
				which the user can draw in. This design made it easier for the user to use the drawing program as it was clearer
				where each function was occurring. It also made it look cleaner. As well as this, I also fixed my issue where
				a random shape would appear when the user would tap the trackpad.
				</p>

				<br>
				<p>Now, instead of a random shape occurring when tapping the trackpad, nothing happens at all. This took
				me a while to figure out, but I found that after making my boundaries for drawing, the issue became resolved. The
				boundaries also work well as the user is able to draw a shape in the space and drag out into the non drawing area
				and a shape will appear. If the user, however, drags from outside in, a shape does not appear. These two functions
				were my intention originally, so I am content with how it works.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In my next sprint I want to add the ability to change the colour of the "tool" that is being used. For example,
				when the user selects rectangle they can change the colour of it and then can click ellipse and the changed colour will
				stay selected.</p>

<h1>Sprint Four</h1>
				<p>In Sprint 4 I added the option to change the colour of the shape selected.</p>
				<img class="img-responsive"  src="assets/img/s_4_plan.png" alt="">
				<img class="img-responsive"  src="assets/img/s_4_plan2.png" alt="">

				<video class="center" controls>
					<source src="assets/vids/sprint_4_test.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				</video>

				<p>For the colour options I tested multiple options before I figured out how to make it work properly.
				I was trying to make it so that it would fill the colour of the object when the colour button is selected.
				I wanted to not have to use text to detect the button being clicked, so I had to think of a new way to do it.
				This video is of my second attempt where I was trying to change colour in button class.</p>

				<video class="center" controls>
					<source src="assets/vids/sprint_4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				</video>

				<p>The design I ended up with has a simple "swatch" system, where the colour will change based on what happens to the swatch.
				Now, when the shape is called in control, instead of having a permanent colour, there is a placeholder-colourname,
				which is related to swatch and makes it so that the colour changes to the colour button selected. This system is very flexible and
				will allow me to easily add more colours.</p>

				<p>In my next sprint I want to add the ability to undo and clear the canvas, as this is a helpful tool for a drawing program.</p>

<h1>Sprint 5</h1>
				<p>In this sprint, I added an undo and a clear button.</p>
				<img class="img-responsive"  src="assets/img/sprint_5_kb.jpg" alt="">
				<img class="img-responsive"  src="assets/img/sprint_5_plan.jpeg" alt="">
				<video class="center" controls>
					<source src="assets/vids/sprint_5.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				</video>

				<p>The undo and clear button were quite simple to achieve. For the undo button, I just added a pop element
				so that the last item on the objectset list (where all the shapes are being pushed into) is removed. For the
				clear button, I just reset the list so it was empty. It was slightly troublesome to figure out where to store
				the clear and undo function, however, as in mUp the user would have to click the button twice for it to work.
				Overall though, I am happy with how it is functioning.</p>

				<p>I am happy with the progress I have made in this sprint. The colours change sufficiently, though in the future I am going
					to look into adding more colours and also making it clearer to see which colour is selected. In my next sprint, I plan on adding
					more shapes, possibly a heart, diamond, star. I also need to reconfigure the sizing and position of my buttons in order
					to fit the new shape buttons.</p>
<h1>Sprint 6</h1>
				<p>In this sprint I added more shapes and redid the format of the program.</p>
				<img class="img-responsive"  src="assets/img/sprint_6_kb.jpg" alt="">
				<img class="img-responsive"  src="assets/img/sprint_6_plan_2.jpg" alt="">
				<p>I wanted to change the design of my page to accommodate space for the buttons for the  new shapes.
				This photo is my original design and I didn't like it, so I redesigned it. The newer design
				is a lot easier and clearer to use, and it looks more cohesive. As can be seen on the plan, </p>
